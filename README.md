# RocketGUI

Simple GUI display for live data from arduino.
The arduino needs to send 8 values each seperated by " , ".
The data is then splices into: orientation: X,Y,Z; control: X, Y and height: acceleration, altitude.
The program will warn you if there is no arduino or a disconnect. You may need to change the COM port.
